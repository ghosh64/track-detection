# lane-detection
lane-detection for track detection, currently testing with movinets

# TODO

establish baseline with inception model trained on kitti dataset, use loss to quantify maybe IoU loss
convert ros images to actual images
annotations? mask annotations?
evaluate accuracy along with memory computation and time

novel contribution?
compare current SOTA?
